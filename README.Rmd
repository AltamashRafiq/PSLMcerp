# PSLMcerp

The goal of PSLMcerp is to provide access to a dashboard making statistical analysis of the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey data more intuitive and easy. This package has been created and made open sourse by the Centre for Economic Research in Pakistan.

## Installation

You can install the released version of PSLMcerp from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("PSLMcerp")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(PSLMcerp)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
